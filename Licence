To include a license file in your Git project, follow these steps:

1. **Create the `LICENSE` file** in the root directory of your Git repository. Here's how you can do it in a terminal:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/git/project
touch LICENSE
```

2. **Edit the `LICENSE` file** with the code for your license. For example, if you are using the MIT license:

```bash
nano LICENSE
```

3. **Copy the MIT License code** into the file and save it:

```
MIT License

```

4. **Save and exit**.

5. **Add the license file to your Git project**:

```bash
git add LICENSE
git commit -m "Add MIT License"
git push origin main
```

This will add the license to your repository. Make sure you modify the year and name in the license text as needed.
